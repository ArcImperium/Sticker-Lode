The website is pretty straightforward if you prefer hands-on experience, but if not I will go step by step in this manual.
First, when you enter the website, there is a project dashboard of all my projects, where you can choose which one you want to use.
After selecting an opition, please go to the line indicated (Calculator: Line 4; To-Do List: Line 6)
Calculator - You can press numbers and functions to create an equation. Pressing the '=' button will evaluate the expression.
If you want to clear the expression, there is a clear button. If there is something wrong, you can always reload the page using the reload button.
To-Do List - You can enter a task and it will display it in a list.
If you want to clear your list, you can jsut reload the page manually.
Each page has a home button at the bottom, which will take you back to the project dashboard.
If you still don't understand how to use this website or have any problems, then you can always contact me, but I may not respond.
